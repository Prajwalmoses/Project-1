        <h1>What is Salesforce customer 360?</h1>
        <p>Salesforce customer 360 isn't a single product it's the entire Salesforce portfolio of technology and services. Salesforce customer 360 is the number one rate customer relationship management platform that helps companies unite their teams with a shared view of every customer, your teams have best in class apps to work from and they all have the same customer data, it's everything that you need to deliver great experiences so that's the short version but let's unpack that and go a little deeper into what that means, we all know data is the fuel computer systems run on and today's companies have more data than ever floating around their computers including customer data and a lot of times all of this data is stored in different systems even when it all belongs to the same business. 
        <br><br>
        it's like you've got your sales team over here using some combination of their inboxes plus spreadsheets to track their deals and then here's your marketing team juggling a few different tools for their campaigns events and content marketing without an easy way to tell sales which leads are ready for some direct outreach that's your service team responding to customers on a completely different system so they can't easily tell marketing who stop emailing they had open ticket and then here is your leadership team they're asking everyone to manually update spreadsheets so they can look at their business big picture but by the time the spreadsheets are updated they're already out of date.
        <br><br>
        This is exactly where Salesforce customer 360 comes in it breaks down those silos so you can connect your teams and data so let's check it out, when teams can easily share information everyone gets a more complete view of customers 360 degree view. your sales team knows who has recently visited your website so they can discover better leads meanwhile your customers who have questions can find your answers faster on your website, self-service portals and chat bots give your customers with frequently asked questions what they want in real time all while giving your agents time to keep customers happy and your marketing department knows which customers have opened cases so they won't reach out to that customer with promotions while they're experiencing technical issues.
        <br><br>
        It's your whole company I'm talking marketing, sales, commerce service and IT teams no matter what size of business or what industry all using the same platform sharing data updating records and seeing that full view of every customer that kind of 360 degree view enables you to deliver seamless consistent experiences and this is what it's like when customer 360 is your single source of truth for all your customer data and it is truly amazing what happens when all of your teams have best in class apps to work from everyone is empowered to work from anywhere and still provides a seamless consistent experience that wows your customers because you know you know your customers want to be wowed.
        <br><br>
        So we got a good idea of what customer 360 is and what it can do to connect people and teams in your business but what do you actually get? right what is included in customer 360 and I think a better question might be what's not included because it covers so much, so let's get a little deeper let's dive in even more. </p>
